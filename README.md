# Rosetta-contributions
My contributions to Rosetta code in an assortment of languages.

## Branching
- Each public branch will be a different language, with different submissions for the rosetta code challenges and implementations.

## Languages
- Most challenges will be done in Rockstar and tested in
https://palfrey.github.io/maiden/
and 
https://codewithrockstar.com/online
intreperters.
- I will also look into implementing the challenges in lesser known esolanguages, JVM languages and different revisions of known languages (old ECMAs for example.)
