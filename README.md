# Rosetta-contributions
My contributions to Rosetta code in an assortment of languages.

## Branching
- Each public branch will be a different language, with different submissions for the rosetta code challenges and implementations.
- Each language branch will have a [language]- development branching off it where stuff is being changed until complete and stable.
- [language] branch will have the stable implementations for the challenges in the purposed language.
- After changes are accepted into Rosetta code or no longer needed (maybe a new better implementation comes up) its merged back to master.

## Languages
- Most challenges will be done in Rockstar and tested in
https://palfrey.github.io/maiden/
and 
https://codewithrockstar.com/online
intreperters.
- I will also look into implementing the challenges in lesser known esolanguages, JVM languages and different revisions of known languages (old ECMAs for example.)
